## Introduction
Snaxter is a new food delivery app that allows users to order food from their favorite restaurants. Users can browse through the menu of their favorite restaurants, add items to their cart, and checkout. Snaxter is a full-stack app built with Django, ReactJs, and Bootstrap.

## Preparation
Preparation began by creating a CHD (Component Hierarchy Diagram) to visualize the components and their relationships.

A wireframe was also created to visualize the layout of the app.

## Backend
The backend was built with Django and Django Rest Framework. The backend is a RESTful API that uses JWT for authentication. The backend is also connected to the frontend via Axios.
